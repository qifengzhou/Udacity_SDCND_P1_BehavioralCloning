# Behaviorial Cloning Project

Overview
---

In this project, the car uses deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. The model learns with data from a human driver. Later the model will output a steering angle to drive an autonomous vehicle in the simulator.

The project have five files: 
* model.py (script used to create and train the model)
* drive.py (script to drive the car - feel free to modify this file)
* model.h5 (a trained Keras model)
* a report writeup file
* video.mp4 (a video recording of the vehicle driving autonomously around the track for one full lap)
